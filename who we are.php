        <div  style="color:grey; text-align:left; font-size:22px;">In the world of revolution,
         we have been through the phases of lectures and handbooks where the only options were the lecturers,
          tuition teachers and the self study from the books but going forward to the era of modernisation we grew from black board
           to white board and from chalks to markers, although covid effected the current education system and made everything virtual
            but now itâ€™s time to break all the stereotypes and revolutionise the current education system and make the studies
             more exciting and fascinating. We as a country are growing through a phase where our literacy rate is not very high or
              sufficient and we are offering the more advanced and efficient way of learning and understanding concepts for students.
               We are here with the advanced education system and with modern solutions for the unique queries of the future generation
                champs to make concepts clear like a crystal.        
         We hope for the future as precisely advanced generation which will evolve like the genius minds.
